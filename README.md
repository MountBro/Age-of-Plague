  1 Introduction
  ══════════════

    The main goal of this project is to accomplish a Trading Card Game
  (TCG) with relatively high playability. The player shoud be able
  to enjoy this game by using just a mouse. In addition, the game
  is also expected to be related to the real world. Up to the moment
  this document is finished, there have been two tutorial levels,
  three formal levels and an endless mode in the game. To associate
  with the real world, which is facing the COVID-19 when this
  project is developed, the game is set in a postwar world where plague
  and viruses are running wild.
