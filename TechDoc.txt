  The game is written mainly in elm, with the aid of css for styling and
  js for handling sound effects.  `Browser.document' is used for the
  overall architecture ( see [package Browser] for more details).

4 Introduction
══════════════

The main goal of this project is to accomplish a Trading Card Game
(TCG) with relatively high playability. The game is also expected
to be related to the real world. Up to the moment this document
is finished, there have been two tutorial levels, three formal
levels and an endless mode in the game. To associate with the
real world, which is facing the COVID-19 when designing this
project, the game is set in a postwar world where plague
and viruses are running wild.


5. Theory
═════════

In this game, the virus transmission algorithm adaptes there
method of "Conway's Game of Life". Detailed transmission of
this algorithm could be found in the file Population.elm
and Virus.elm

6. Website architecture
═══════════════════════

In this website, the main core of the game is designed in elm lang.
And the main page and the card gallery are designed in elm and CSS.
CSS files are to make them more beautiful and attractive.

The structrue for sites folder is like the following:

- sites
|- css: all the CSS files
|- assets
  |- cardPNG: all the cards pictures
  |- font: the fonts for the websites
  |- guide: the skeleton sketch for the game guide
  |- icons: the icons for the game UI
  |- sound
    |- card: all the sounds for cards
|- index.html: the "main" file for our web app game
|- elm.js: the game core
|- sound.js: the game sound effects
